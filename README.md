# basketball-counter

This is a simple basketball counter app that will show the scores of both the Home team and the Guest team.

The app is used to practise basic JavaScript logic like making functions and practise CSS skills.

I have added a reset button that will not enable the user to reset the scores of both the teams involved.

I have used netlify to deploy the app:
